Cucumber Live Class

--programming language- java
--tools - to automate - selenium (it is used to automate only web based application (UI))
    ---report
    ---control of execution
    User Story = Login functionality validation

    Test cases - valid login
            in Cucumber/Gherkin/BDD

    Test cases - invalid login

    Java - language
    Maven - build too
    Selenium - added
    Cucumber - added
    Properties File - added
    Excel File - added

    Test case 1 - Search employee by id
    Test case 2 - search employee by name

    tagname
    tags = "@chikhi or @godwill"// one of the conditions must be true then it will execute
    tags ="@chikhi and @godwill"// both the conditions must be true then it will execute

    tagname

    @chiki or @godwill - only the test case having one of the tags will be executed
    @chiki and @godwill - only the test case having both the tags available will be executed

    Live Class 2
    feature files - Scenarios we write in feature file
    step definition class-to keep all step definitions in it
    test runner class - feature, glue- providing package of step def, dry run -to generate missing step
    definition, plugin - for reporting purpose, tags - to execute one/multiple scenarios as needed batch wise execution

     Background
     it is applicable for one feature file
     till the time flow is same across all the all the scenarios in feature file, we can keep them in background
     Background will be executed before every scenario

     Hooks -
     We keep pre-condition and post condition of the project in it
     hooks are applicable for the entire project
     hooks close  will always be in steps package

     order of execution
     --hooks - background -- scenario
      data driven testing - to execute one test case against multiple set of data

Cucumber class 3 -
POM Page object model design pattern - for single screen, ypu have one pade class
- under this class, you keep locators/web elements/objects repository belong to that page

assertions - to validate all the required fields, values, button, options
assertequals - when you have to compare 2 values together

if it is passing, it will not give you any message
if it is failing, it will give you assertion error


rerun plugin - when we execute our test cases  and some of them are failed, then it gets the path of
those failed test cases and keep it under one file and then we can execute this file to check only failed test
cases.

excel file - excel reader and calling it in scripts
page object model design pattern
assertions - assert equals and asserttrue
page initializer
rerun plugin
failed runner
regression runner
html report

what is pending -
cucumber report with screenshot
maven lifecycle
execution from pom.xml file

Class no 4
reports - for local reference

scalable
mature
reusable
no hard coded data
single point execution

maven surefire plugin - it makes your project to single build

phases of maven
clean - it deleted the target folder
validate - it checks the validity of the code
compile - it compiles
test - it executes the code
package - it converts into package
verify
install - it installs all the required jars and plugins
site
deploy - it deploys the code

test- install, validate, compile, package , test
